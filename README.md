-   Blade is a Template engine which makes it eaasier to work with data and logic inside the view than regular PHP does.

-   When a user types a URL and hits "Send," the web browser sends a request to the server hosting the website. The server passes this request to a route file, which examines the requested URL and determines the appropriate action. This action could involve processing data, saving it to a database, retrieving data, or injecting data into a view. The server then sends the response back to the user, allowing them to see the processed information in their web browser.

-   When passind data to the view, we add a second argument to the VIEW function which the data we want to pass to the view.

-   Query Parameters are ways we can add/inject values or variables into our URL.
